SETS:
Sets in phyton can be defined as mutable dynamic collections of immutable unique elements. The elements contained in a set must be immutable. Sets may seem very similar to lists, but in reality they are very different. First, they may only contain unique elements, so no duplicates are allowed. Thus, sets can be used to remove duplicates from a list. Next,like sets in mathematics, they have unique operations which can be applied to them such as set union, intersection,etc.

TUPLES:
Tuples are almost identical to lists, so they contain an ordered collection of elements, expect for one property: they are immutable. We would use tuples if we needed a datastructure that, once created, cannot be modified anymore. Futheremore, tuples can be used as dictionary keys if all the elements are immutable.

DICTIONARY:
Dictionaries in python are very similar to real-world dictionaries. These are mutable data structures that contain a collection of keys and, associated with them, values. This structure makes them very similar to word-definition dictionaries.Dictionaries are used to quickly access certain data associated with a unique key. Uniqueness is essential, as we need to access only certain pieces of information and not confuse it with other entries.
